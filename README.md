checks
======

This contains the source data and tooling necessary to publish checks for [canary.io](http://canary.io).

## Adding a Site to canary.io

If you'd like to add a URL to the list:

* fork this repo
* update `checks.yml`, adding a new site to the list
* open a pull request

We will review and merge your PR as quickly as possible.  We're currently only accepting a small number of sites while we gauge capacity and get a better understanding of our operational surface.
